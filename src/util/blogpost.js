    title: "ChatGPT's new 'Browse with Bing': Watching AIs stalk you is odd",
    content:
      "This week, I logged into ChatGPT to continue testing its ChatGPT   plugins feature, only to notice a new addition to the beta featuresection: Browse with Bing. Needless to say, I jumped on it — whodoesn’t love a new toy? — and put it through its paces. However, not only was I amazed by how powerful this new feature is, I was alittle unsettled by how it could be used as well.",

      "If you compare ChatGPT and Google Bard, one of the advantagesGoogle&#10076;s Bard has had until now is that it answers you using current search data, while ChatGPT has been stuck working off data it was trained on from 2021. This means the chatbot didn&#10076;treally know much about the world and events after this time. Honestly, that&#10076;s terrible; it meant ChatGPT was stuck in timeat the height of the Covid pandemic. Spare a thought for the poorchatbot, stuck e-shopping and thinking Tiger King is the height of TV culture. Jokes aside, this limitation has meant while Bard could confidently go into detail with its answers, ChatGPT has had to play it a bit more coy. After all, how embarrassing would it be if it got the current owner of Twitter wrong? But now, this key differentiator is gone. OpenAI has said it will start using Bing as the default search experience for ChatGPT. While ChatGPT Plus users get first access to it, it will soon be rolled out to free users as well, erasing the feature lead Bard had. Worse, Bard doesn&#10076;t have the Plugins feature yet, so this puts Google solidly behind.",
    subtitle2: "Bing-powered ChatGPT does multiple searches per query",
    subcontent2:
      "When you turn on this new feature, one of the immediately obvious things is that ChatGPT doesn't just do one search, it looks around until it gets the answer it&'s after. You can check out its thought pattern by clicking on the little button above the answer you get, and it's honestly fascinating to see the hoops it leaps through to get to the final result.",
